CSS Variables (Custom Properties) allow you to store specific values to be reused throughout your document.

## Why use them?

1. **Maintainability**: Change a value in one place, update it everywhere.
2. **Dynamic Theming**: Change variables with JavaScript to create dark/light modes.
3. **Readability**: Semantic naming for colors and spacing.
