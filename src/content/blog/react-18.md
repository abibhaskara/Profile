React 18 introduces a new root API and concurrent features that allow for better performance and user experience.

## Automatic Batching

React 18 now automatically batches state updates, reducing the number of re-renders.

## Concurrent Features

Features like `useTransition` and `useDeferredValue` allow you to mark updates as non-urgent, keeping the UI responsive.
